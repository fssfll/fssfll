# FSS FLL Spring Training

## Getting Started
Welcome to the FSS FLL Micropython for EV3 Training Course!  A set of short lessons below are divided between using a virtual robot simulator and lessons run on the EV3.

After completing each lesson module, students are expected to share their solutions with mentors to get credit for the lesson before moving to the next module. 

When all the training modules are complete, students can move on to the **2022 Bolton Robotics Spring Training Game**.  In this game you will get to build with legos onto an EV3 basebot and create your own programs!  This is like the official FLL competition in the fall and has a series of fun challenges for you solve in a two minutes and thirty second run.

## Don't Panic!
Everyone *-including the mentors-* are excited to help each other learn something new!  If you get stuck, please ask for help.  If you figure out how to do something new and amazing, share it with the students & mentors :-)
