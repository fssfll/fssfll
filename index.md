Welcome to the Bolton Robotics Group, where creativity, innovation, and teamwork come together in the exciting world of FIRST LEGO League robotics! Our group supports enthusiastic middle school students who share a passion for robotics and using the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot.

On this website, we've gathered a set of resources aimed at helping students and mentors user Pybricks Python to program Lego EV3 robots.   Whether you're a beginner eager to take your first steps in coding or an experienced programmer looking to enhance your skills, our resources are designed to introduce basic concepts, provide tutorials, tips, and real-world examples.

In addition to Pybricks Python resources, we've also gatheter a collection of FIRST LEGO League resources. These materials cover a wide range of topics ensuring that teams are well-prepared for the challenges and excitement that come with participating in FIRST LEGO League competitions.

## Training Modules
A series of short training modules lessons below are divided between using a virtual robot simulator and lessons run on the EV3.  It is recommended to start with the Beginner training modules which all use the virtual robot and simulator.  These lessons can be completed without any additional apps or EV3 hardware.

The intermediate lessons focus on how to get started using Microsoft Visual Studio to program the EV3 with the Bolton Robotics Base Code.  Advanced and expert modules guide students who are interested in advanced techniques like gyro navigation, color sensor calibration, using the EV3 display, and ssh connection to the EV3 robot. 

- [Beginner](./lessons/beginner/beginner.md) : Using the simulator to learn about how to use Python programming on a virtual EV3 robot
- [Intermediate](./lessons/intermediate/intermediate.md) : Learn how to use VSC to program the robot
- Advanced : TBD
- Expert : TBD

## Bolton Robotics "Around Bolton" Game
The Bolton Robotics Around Bolton Game is like a real FLL challenge on a 1/3 size game board.  Students program their EV3 robot to solve missions and collect as many points as possible in a two minute and thirty second match.
- [Bolton Robotics "Around Bolton" Robot Game](./spring_2022/robot_game.md) : After completing all lessons students may work on the robot game.

## Additional How-To's (students are not required to complete this training)
- [Helpful Python Commands](./howto/Python_Commands.pdf) : List of helpful commands including how to use attachment motors
- [Color Sensor Calibration](./calibration/calibration.md) : Color Sensor Calibration Routine for line following
- [All About the Gyro Sensor](./gyro/gyro.md) : Gyro sensor description, calibration and use.
- [Rename The EV3](./rename/rename.md) : How to rename the EV3 (this is the name displayed when connecting to the robot in Visual Studio Code)
- [TroubleShooting Guide](./troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md) : A collection of learnings about what to do when "it doesn't work"
