**Why won't Pybricks IDE connect to the robot?**
* Make sure your robot is powered on the the bluetooth button has a blinking blue led ring around it.  If the bluetooth LED is not blinking press the bluetooth button.

**Why doesn't my code run?**
* There could be a syntax error.  The Pybricks IDE will often highlight the error as a "Traceback" and ask if you want to go to the problem.  
* Remember Python is very picky about indentation.  Code must have the same indentation level, code within a method or while loop must be indented further. Here's an example of an indentation error Traceback
  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "mission_one.py", line 24
  IndentationError: unexpected indent
```
