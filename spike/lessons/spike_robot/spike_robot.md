title: Building Your Lego Spike Robot
subtitle:
---

# Introduction
In this lesson, you will be building a Spike Prime robot with a compact and practical design. It uses two large motors to drive the wheels, a color sensor for navigation or detecting lines, and two additional motors for attachments—one mounted vertically and one horizontally. This setup keeps the robot small and maneuverable, making it easier to navigate around the FLL game table. It’s also simple to build, which means more time for coding and testing. Plus, the design supports drop-on attachments, so syou can quickly swap out tools for different missions without needing to rebuild the robot each time.

# Wiring Instructions:
Route the wires as neatly as possible by using the wire clips and folding extra wire and storing in the unused internal space between the large drive motors.  Use the table below to determine where to connect the motors and sensors.

**Spike Port** | **Motor or Sensor**

Port A | Color Sensor
Port B | Not Connected
Port C | Left Attachment Motor (vertical in front)
Port D | Right Attachment Motor (horizontal on right)
Port E | Left Drive Motor
