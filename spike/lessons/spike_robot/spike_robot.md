title: Building Your Lego Spike Robot
subtitle:
---

# Introduction
In this lesson, you will be building a Spike Prime robot with a compact and practical design. It uses two large motors to drive the wheels, a color sensor for navigation or detecting lines, and two additional motors for attachments—one mounted vertically and one horizontally. This setup keeps the robot small and maneuverable, making it easier to navigate around the FLL game table. It’s also simple to build, which means more time for coding and testing. Plus, the design supports drop-on attachments, so students can quickly swap out tools for different missions without needing to rebuild the robot each time.

The Bolton Robotics Base Code is a set of starter Python files designed to help students quickly get their Spike robot ready for FIRST Lego League challenges. It includes a pre-made robot class that handles things like motor ports, sensor setup, and wheel size, so you don’t have to start from scratch. This saves time and lets you focus more on solving problems and writing code. The base code also has a simple menu that lets you choose from up to nine programs, making it easy to switch between different tasks during practice or competition. Overall, it’s a helpful tool for getting organized, experimenting with ideas, and building smarter solutions faster.

# Wiring Instructions:
Route the wires as neatly as possible by using the wire clips and folding extra wire and storing in the unused internal space between the large drive motors.  Use the table below to determine where to connect the motors and sensors.

**Spike Port** | **Motor or Sensor**
--- | ---
Port A | Color Sensor
Port B | Not Connected
Port C | Left Attachment Motor (vertical in front)
Port D | Right Attachment Motor (horizontal on right)
Port E | Left Drive Motor
Port F | Right Drive Motor
