Bolton Robotics has been using Python to program Spike robots for FIRST Lego League, and it's made coding both powerful and approachable. Python is easy to learn, which means teams can focus on solving challenges instead of getting stuck on complicated code. It’s also great for debugging—finding and fixing mistakes quickly so your robot does what you want. Since Python is used by real engineers, you’re getting hands-on experience with a professional tool. It also makes teamwork and sharing code simple, so everyone can contribute and learn from each other. Whether you're building, coding, or collaborating, Python helps your team work smarter and go further.


# Gather what you need
Before you jump into the modules, make sure you have everything ready to go. These materials come from the Bolton Robotics Club, and here's what you'll need:

Lego Spike Robot: 
You’ll need a Spike robot with at least two medium motors and some wheels so it can move around and take on challenges.

Computer with Bluetooth and Internet Access: 
You'll need a computer (Windows or Chromebook) with Bluetooth and internet. This is where you'll write your code and connect to your robot using Pybricks.
