subtitle: Introduction To MicroPython and EV3 Robots
---
Get ready for an exciting journey into the world of Python programming for your LEGO EV3 robot! In this series of beginner-friendly training modules, you'll learn how to make your robot move and tackle various missions. Don't worry if you don't have a physical robot yet â€“ we've got you covered with a virtual robot and a simulator that mimics the real EV3 experience.

Before you jump into the more advanced training, make sure to complete each of these introductory modules. They'll lay the foundation for your coding skills and prepare you for the challenges that lie ahead in the intermediate level training. Happy coding!

# EV3 Robots

# Micropython
MicroPython is like a language that helps you talk to your LEGO EV3 robot. You can use it to give your robot cool instructions, like telling it to move around or do tricks. It's like teaching your robot a special code so that it understands what you want it to do. So, with MicroPython, you get to be the boss and make your robot do all kinds of fun stuff!
