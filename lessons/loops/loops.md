## What is a programming loop?
 * A loop in a computer program is an instruction that repeats until a specified condition is reached. In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer requires action, it is executed.
 * In Python, there are two main types of programming loops.  The **for** loopi and the **while** loop.  In this lesson we'll focus on the **while** loop.
 * The **while** loop is a programming concept that will execute a block of code over and over again while a given condition holds true.
 * You need three components to create a while loop:
   1. The **while** keyword
   2. A condition that can be tested to see if it is True or False
   3. A block of code that you want to run repeatedly
 * With that in mind, let's try an example.  
 * Start the [FSS FLL Simulator](https://fssfll.github.io/gears/public/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffssfll.github.io%2Ffssfll%2Flessons%2Flesson1%2Flesson1.json)
 * Make sure you are running in Python Pybricks Mode
 * Copy the code in in below (be careful to include it below "Where your code starts")
 * If your computer has speakers, turn up the volume to hear The Count!
 * Goto the simulator tab and hit the play triangle

```python
################################################
# Here is where your code starts
################################################

# Set a variable count to 1
count = 1

# Create a loop which will run as long as the count is
# less than or equal to 3.
while (count <= 3):
    # Print to the console the number followed by  ...ah... ah... ah...
    print(str(count) + " ...ah... ah... ah...")
    # Have the robot say the number followed by  ...ah... ah... ah...
    ev3.speaker.say(str(count) + " ...ah... ah... ah...")
    # Add 1 to the count every time the loop executes
    count = count + 1
```

* There are just a few programming rules which need to be followed (this is called **syntax**) which needs to be followed for the loop to make sense.
* Let's take a look at them using the example above.
* The while loop and condition tested must be followed by a colon **:**

```python
while (count <= 3):
```

* All the lines in the block of code that you want to run repeatedly must be indented by the same amount of spaces.
* In the example below, we can set the variable count back to 1 after the loop runs.

```python
while (count <= 3):
    # Print to the console the number followed by  ...ah... ah... ah...
    print(str(count) + " ...ah... ah... ah...")
    # Have the robot say the number followed by  ...ah... ah... ah...
    ev3.speaker.say(str(count) + " ...ah... ah... ah...")
    # Add 1 to the count every time the loop executes
    count = count + 1

# Set count back to 1.  This is not indented and would not be part of the while loop above.
count = 1
```

* You must follow the correct programming rules (syntax) for you program to run! 

## Now it is your turn!

### 1. In a different browser window or browser tab start the simulator: 

  * [Launch FSS FLL Simulator: Code Loops](https://fssfll.github.io/gears/public/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffssfll.github.io%2Ffssfll%2Flessons%2Flesson1%2Flesson1.json)
  * Make sure you are in Python "Pybricks Mode"

### 2. Copy in the example program below and try out the already completed "Part 1"

### 3. Follow the instructions in the code comments below to complete "Part 2" of the assignment

```python
#!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython

# Import the necessary libraries
import math
import time
from pybricks.parameters import *
from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick
from pybricks.ev3devices import *
from pybricks.tools import wait
from pybricks.robotics import DriveBase

# Create the sensors and motors objects
ev3 = EV3Brick()

motorB = Motor(Port.B)
motorC = Motor(Port.C)
left_motor = motorB
right_motor = motorC

color_sensor_in1 = ColorSensor(Port.S1)


robot = DriveBase(left_motor, right_motor, wheel_diameter=56, axle_track=89)
robot.settings(straight_speed=200, straight_acceleration=100, turn_rate=100, turn_acceleration=100)

################################################
# Here is where your code starts
################################################

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#                           PART 1
#
# Drive forward three times using a while loop
#-----------------------------------------------------------
count = 1
while (count <= 3):
  # Drive forward 100 millimeters
  robot.straight(100)
  # Increment the count
  count = count + 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#                           PART 2
#
# Now it is your turn to add on to the program.
# Make the robot drive in square shape using a while loop
# A square shape can be made by driving straight and then turning right 4 times
#
# Use the robot.straight() method to move forward
# Use the robot.turn() method to turn 90 degrees
# Use the print() function to debug your program
#-----------------------------------------------------------

# Use print() to say your program is starting
print("Start driving in a square shape")

# Create a variable count and set it to 1

# Define a while loop which will run as long as the count is
# less than or equal to 4.  Remember to end the line with a :

  # Use robot.straight() to move forward.  
  # This needs to be indented.
  
  # Use robot.turn() to turn the robot 90 degrees. 
  # This needs to be indented.
  
  # Increment the count

# Use print() that the program is done.
# This is not part of the block of code to be repeated.
# This should not be indented.


```
