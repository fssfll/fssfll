# Square Up The Robot On Mission Model


EV3 robots (both real world and virtual) hardly ever do the same thing every time.  This is because ther are slight variations in how the robot is started, wheel pre-loading, friction and many other factors that result in the robot driving a little more left, right, further, not as far even when the same program is run.  This can be frustrating!  Fortunately, there are tricks to improve your chances of success even when the robot goes a little off course.  There's a clever maneuver known as "squaring up." Essentially, it involves the robot purposefully driving into the mission model to nail that perfect alignment. To up the robot's game, teams often design in a funnel-like attachment. This contraption acts as a friendly guide, making sure the robot stays on track and hits the mark, even if it had veered a bit off course. With this setup, the robot becomes more consistent in competition.

An example funnel aligmnent attachment is shown below:


Your assignment is to determine how much a funnel alignment attachment helps to improve consistency in knocking over the green scoring tower without knocking over the red penalty towers:


# 
Use the simulator to come up with a simple robot program that drives down the road and attempts to knock over the scoring tower.  After you have the program able to sometimes knock over the green scoring tower (it probably won't work every time) stop changing your program.  Run your program 10 times and record how many times you were able to knock over the green tower and leave the two red towers standing.

# Adding A Funnel Attachment
Copy or recreate the same program with the link below. This is the same challenge with an improved robot that adds a funnel alignment guide.  Again, run your program 10 times and record how many times you were able to knock over the green tower and leave the two red towers standing.
