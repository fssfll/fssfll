## Loops can be used for robot moevement
  * Use loops to drive on an curved path for specific distance  
  * Use loops to line follow

### Driving on a curved path
 * Tank turns (turning in place without moving) is a great tool, but what if you needed to drive on a curved path?
 * The robotics **drive(drive_speed, turn_rate)** method can be used to drive on a curved path but notice that it does not have distance as an input parameter.
 * Using the **drive()** method by itself will make your robot drive in circles until you press the stop button or the batteries run out!
 * Using the **drive()** method inside a while loop allows you to control the distance.
 * Let's try an example.
 * Start the [FSS FLL Simulator: Line Following](https://fssfll.github.io/gears/public/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffssfll.github.io%2Ffssfll%2Flessons%2Fdriving_with_loops%2Flinefollowing.json)

```python
# Create and define distance, speed, and turn variables
# to control how fast the robot moves, how sharp it turns, and how far it will go.
speed = 75
turn = -25
distance = 250

# While the robot.distance() is less than or equal to the variable 'distance' stay in the while loop
while (robot.distance() <= distance):
  robot.drive(speed,turn)
  print("The robot has moved " + str(robot.distance()) + " mm")

# robot.drive() goes on forever, even after the while loop ends.
# You need to stop the robot after exiting the while loop
robot.stop()
```

### Line following
 * The same approach can be used to follow a line using a color sensor and a proporitional feedback loop.


```python
# Create and define a proportional gain variable for line following
pd = -0.8

# Create and define distance and speed variables
distance = 1000
speed = 100

while (robot.distance() <= distance):
  # The turn direction is equal to the gain x (color sensor value - 50)
  turn = pd * (color_sensor_in1.reflection() - 50)
  robot.drive(speed,turn)

# Stop the robot
robot.stop()
```

## Now it is your turn!

### 1. In a different browser window or browser tab start the simulator: 

  * [Launch FSS FLL Simulator: Line Following Challenge](https://fssfll.github.io/gears/public/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffssfll.github.io%2Ffssfll%2Flessons%2Fdriving_with_loops%2Flinefollowing2.json)
  * Make sure you are in Python "Pybricks Mode"

### 2. Copy in the example program below and try out the already completed "Part 1"

### 3. Follow the instructions in the code comments below to complete "Part 2" of the assignment

```python
#!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython

# Import the necessary libraries
import math
import time
from pybricks.parameters import *
from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick
from pybricks.ev3devices import *
from pybricks.tools import wait
from pybricks.robotics import DriveBase

# Create the sensors and motors objects
ev3 = EV3Brick()

motorB = Motor(Port.B)
motorC = Motor(Port.C)
left_motor = motorB
right_motor = motorC

color_sensor_in1 = ColorSensor(Port.S1)


robot = DriveBase(left_motor, right_motor, wheel_diameter=56, axle_track=89)
robot.settings(straight_speed=200, straight_acceleration=100, turn_rate=100, turn_acceleration=100)

#                           PART 1
#
# The variables are defined for you here.

# Create and define a proportional gain variable for line following

print("pd = " + str(pd))

print("speed = " + str(speed))

ev3.speaker.say(“Way to go!  Now work on Part 2”)
#-----------------------------------------------------------
#                           PART 2
#
# Use the variables above to create a line following program
#-----------------------------------------------------------

# Add a while loop like shown in the lesson example and
# adjust the variables to complete the mission.


# Stop the robot

# Use ev3.speaker.say() to have the robot say you're done!
