## About the EV3 Display Screen
 - The EV3 display screen is made up of an array of pixels which is like a piece of graph paper where each box is a pixel that can either be colored in or left blank.
 - The EV3 display is 178 pixels wide by 127 pixels high.
 - The width of the display is the "x" axis
 - The height of the display is the "y" axis
 - The origin of the display is in the top left corner.  This means the top left corner has position x=0 and y=0.
 - The picture below shows the "x" and "y" axis on the EV3 display along with some simple graphics made using turning on some pixels

## Displaying a text message
 - Use the **draw_text(x,y,*text*)** method to display text to the EV3 display
 - **x** is how far over from the top-left corner of the display to start your text message
 - **y** is how far down from the top-left corner of the display to start your text message
 - **text** is the text message you want to display.

## A Simple Example
 - Print "Hello World" to the display
 - Notice that the quotes are needed but are not displayed on the screen
 - Give this example a try!

```python
###################################
# Here is where your code starts
###################################
# Write "Hello World" on the EV3 Display
# Use the position:
#   x = 0
#   y = 0
ev3.screen.draw_text(0, 0, "Hello World")
# Let the program run for 2 seconds
wait(2000)
# Clear the Screen
ev3.screen.clear()
# Let the program run for 2 more seconds
wait(2000)
```

## Another Example
 - Print the x,y coordinates of the message on the display
 - Add a loop and repeatedly print the message while moving it down and to the right 1 pixel
 - Give this example a try, how could you change it to do something different?

```python
###################################
# Here is where your code starts
###################################
# Create a variable i and set it equal to zero
i=0
# Create a loop which will run 128 times
while i < 128:
    # Clear the screen
    ev3.screen.clear()
    # Display the (x,y) location on the screen
    ev3.screen.draw_text(i, i, "(x=" + str(i) + ",y=" + str(i) + ")")
    # Add 1 to i.  This will move the mesage down one and to the right one
    i = i + 1
    # Wait 100 mS (that is 10% or 1/10th of a second!)
    wait(100)
```

## There's More!
 - There's more you can do with the display like drawing shapes and displaying pictures
 - Check out the EV3 Micropython documentation if you'd like to learn more.

## Now it is your turn!

### 1. Start Visual Studio Code and Connect to your EV3 Robot

### 2. Copy in the example program below and try out the already completed "Part 1"

### 3. Follow the instructions in the code comments below to complete "Part 2" of the assignment

```python
################################################
# Here is where your code starts
################################################

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#                           PART 1
#
# A simple Example of printing to the EV3 screen
#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Write "Hello World" on the EV3 Display
# Use the position:
#   x = 0
#   y = 0
ev3.screen.draw_text(0, 0, "Hello World")
# Let the program run for 2 seconds
wait(2000)
# Clear the Screen
ev3.screen.clear()
# Let the program run for 2 more seconds
wait(2000)

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#                           PART 2
#
# Display 4 new messages to the EV3 Screen
#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Display the text "TL" at (x=0,y=0)

# Display the text "TR" at (x=150,y=0)

# Display the text "BR" at (x=0,y=100)

# Display the text "BL" at (x=150,y=100)

# Wait for 5 seconds

```
