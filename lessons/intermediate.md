Bolton Robotics has been rocking First Lego League competitions with EV3 robots using Python, and it's super awesome and easy! Here's the lowdown:

__Easy Peasy Python:__ Python is like the superhero language for programming. It's super easy to use, which means you spend more time having fun and solving cool challenges with your robot instead of getting stuck in tricky coding stuff.

__Fixing Mistakes is a Breeze:__ Python makes fixing mistakes (aka debugging) a piece of cake. You can quickly figure out what's going wrong and make your robot do exactly what you want it to do. No more head-scratching!

__Teamwork Galore:__ Python is like the ultimate team player. You and your pals can work on different parts of the project at the same time without stepping on each other's toes. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?

__Sharing is Caring:__ With Python, it's super easy to share your awesome code with other teams. Imagine all the cool ideas bouncing around and making everyone's robots even cooler. Co-Opertition and sharing is caring, and Python makes it a breeze.

And get this - using Python is way cooler than the old EV3G blocks. It's like upgrading from a tricycle to a turbocharged bike!  You are learning the same programming language as used by professional engineers! So, get ready to dive into the Python fun and take your EV3 robot to new heights in your Lego League journey. It's going to be a blast!
