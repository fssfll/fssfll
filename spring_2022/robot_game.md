# Spring 2022 FSS FLL Robot Game


After completing the python lessons it is now time for the 2022 FSS FLL Spring Training Robot Game!  For this game, the standard FLL table is divided into 3 identical smaller game areas.
All game areas have identical mission models, table setup, and scoring so students are free to choose any that may be available.

The game mat is shown below:
